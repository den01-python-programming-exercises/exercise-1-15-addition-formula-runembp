# Exercise 1.15 - Addition formula

Create a program that can be used to add two integers together. In the beginning, the user is asked to give two integers that are to be summed. The program then prints the formula that describes the addition of the numbers.

Example output:

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*8*
Give the second number:
*3*
8 + 3 = 11
```

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*73457*
Give the second number:
*12888*
73457 + 12888 = 86345
```
